  1.Hhis is a just naive git log analyse tool

  2.Runing system must have expect installed 

  3.Target system must has sshd running

  4.The targetsystem's username,passwd,targetdir(of git repository)
	are configure in  gitlogsetting.conf target author names and time
	spans are also configured there.

  5.How to run :
		1>the main here is gitloganalyse.py,so to run this little 
		  tool you have to key in "python gitloganalyse.py"

		2>the commitLimit.py here is for generate git log command

		3>the configparse.py is for parse the configure file
		  (here is gitlogsetting.conf)

		4>the execRemoteCommand.py here is used to login remote
		  machine using configured username and passwd ,change into
		  targetdir and exec corresponding command.
		  
		5>the expectscp.sh is a shell that copy remote file into local
		  machine.

		6>the gitlogsetting.conf is a configure file which is ugly now.
		  (i will improve it soon)
	
 6.Some explain: 
		the tool run like this:

		1> parse configure file 
		2> login in target machine and change into target dir
		3> do staff...(running command) 
		4> redirect command executing result to a temp file 
		5> copy remote temp file to a local one
		6> read local temp file and print it out
